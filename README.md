<h1>Side Scroller Game</h1>

This is my first attempt at making a side scroller game with javascript. 

I'm using a tutorial (https://youtu.be/7JtLHJbm0kA?si=sozt2BlZPUJxm70Z) to help me create the initial prototype for my own game project.

I'm working on the game design document. However, I'm still in the ideating stages of designing the game.
